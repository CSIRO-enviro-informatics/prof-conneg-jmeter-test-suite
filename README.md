# prof-conneg-test-suite

This repository contains an [Apache jMeter](http://jmeter.apache.org/) test suite for testing adherence of HTTP and Query String Argument implementations of the [Content Negotiation By Profile](https://w3c.github.io/dxwg/conneg-by-ap/) currently under development (circa October 2018) by the [Dataset Exchange Working Group](https://www.w3.org/2017/dxwg/).

**NOTE:** this repository is likely temporary as this test suite will move to a more official location as arrangements for its continued hosting are finalised.
